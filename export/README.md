# `export`

> This folder contains the end result of the project, all ready to distribute!
> 
> This will of course be the actual film, perhaps in a handful of encodings and qualities. But it may also contain public exhibition articles such as:
> - Copy text for blurbs and showcases
> - Concept sketches 
> - Work breakdown screen recordings
> - "Making of" videos
> - "Developer commentary"
> 
> No file under `export` should be for internal use only. Assume it is a public resource, even if we intend to sell it ğŸ¤‘!
