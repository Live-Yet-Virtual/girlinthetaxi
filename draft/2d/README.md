# `2d`

This `draft` folder would contain the 2D assets for this project, which is the majority of the rendered assets in our case. 

This includes both the `.kra` source files, as well as the `.png` or `.exr` assets they render. 

We would likely only have a single source file, but many rendered assets, all clearly named according to their identity. We shouldn't need subfolders to group those exported assets, but if we do, we would certainly add them in.
