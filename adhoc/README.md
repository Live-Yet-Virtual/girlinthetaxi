# `adhoc`

> This folder may contain _anything_, really. Because nothing stored in this folder will ever be backed up or pushed to the repository and shared with collaborators.
> 
> This folder exists solely to store ad-hoc scratch files, such as when:
> - Temporary caches
> - You quickly want to duplicate a file for some testing
> - Want to move your bad ideas out of the working folders
> - Just that one meme that was really relevant to a discussion on Discord
> - ~~Your nudes~~
> 
> Treat it as a trash bin. Not for storing anything important worth storing whatsoever!
