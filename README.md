# `draft`

> This folder contains all our production files.
>
> That is to say both source files, such as:
> - Actual source files that either produce those texture
> - Audio-editing/-recording app files that produce foley or voice-overs
> - Video-editing app files that likely consume rendered frames
>
> As well as exported assets required by other source files, such as:
> - Textures, masks, decals, cells
> - Foley, voice-overs
> - Rendered frames or videos, even incomplete ones
> - Recorded or rendered videos, if they're required by other source files
>
> But _not_ any of the end-products! Files under `draft` are all implicitly internal.
