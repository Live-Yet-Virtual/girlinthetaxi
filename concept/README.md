# `concept `

> This folder contains conceptual works, such as:
> - Early exploratory sketches
> - Look-development illustrations
> - Character-design roughs and variations
> - Actual cleaned character-design sheets
> - Scripts, storyboards, etc
> 
> These are works produced during the project, albeit for the artists' conceptual reference.


Note: A common practice in non-version-controlled projects is to duplicate files while exploring variations. This is fine for exploring variations, and this, under `concept`, but strongly discouraged elsewhere. 

And even then, only for alternate variations. Do NOT create duplicates for versioning. If you want to retain past versions—perhaps for archival or for others to review—do so by exporting the source files to sharable formats and commit or tag the current form to Git. 

I repeat, do NOT create duplicatge source files for versioning.
